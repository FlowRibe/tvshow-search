## Information

Inspired by this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIrL2Nnjvbk

I used Node js version 16.14.0.

Sometimes loading can take some seconds because of tvmaze API and it's limited to 20 requests every 10 seconds !

PS: no need to use server/api in reality you can call directly the API tv maze with corresponding urls.
